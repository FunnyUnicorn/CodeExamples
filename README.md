# CodeExamples
You can find examples of my code in this repository.
Here are two files with my Data Science course projects using Streamlit library for code visualization in html format.
In the Pok√©mon project, I presented information about them using different visualization methods (pie char, scatter plot, etc).
In the Final Project, I visualized the dynamics of google query popularity using google trends data and also built a linear regression to predict the future movement of the query popularity index.
You can also find my International Finance project in the repository.
In it I implemented trading strategy momentum+reversal using different currencies.
